> Othello game framework which can be use for adding Othello AI Agents..



This is an an Othello/Riversi game made in Java using JavaFX GUI Framework. 
The game allows you to implement and add your own AI agents which you will then be able to test and play againts. OthelloFX comes with 3 different Agent implementations excluding the usual ones such as MiniMax which you will have to implement on your own. The game can be ran in multiple modes:

* Human Player vs Human Player
* Humna Player vs AI Agent
* AI Agent vs AI Agent.

The game also .

## Getting Started

Refer to the main folder in order to find the documented files you need. There you will see the [User Settings](https://github.com/EudyContreras/Othello-FX-Framework/blob/master/Othello%20FX%20Edu/src/main/UserSettings.java) file, [Agent Manager](https://github.com/EudyContreras/Othello-FX-Framework/blob/master/Othello%20FX%20Edu/src/main/AgentManager.java) in which you will run your agent, as well as various example agents and implementations. Take a look at the [Agent Controller](https://github.com/EudyContreras/Othello-FX-Framework/blob/master/Othello%20FX%20Edu/src/com/eudycontreras/othello/controllers/AgentController.java) for useful methods, etc


#### Move

Implement a move if necessary or use the existing implementation. A move must extend from [Abstract Move](https://github.com/EudyContreras/Othello-FX-Framework/blob/master/Othello%20FX%20Edu/src/com/eudycontreras/othello/capsules/AbstractMove.java) Implements the compareTo method and the IsValid. In those methods you define what makes a move better than the other as well as how you define a move as valid. Take a look at [Move Wrapper](https://github.com/EudyContreras/Othello-FX-Framework/blob/master/Othello%20FX%20Edu/src/com/eudycontreras/othello/capsules/MoveWrapper.java) for an example of how a move is implemented. Only the isValid and the compareTo method are needed by the framework but as you can see you can also create your own helper methods.


> Example Move class which extends from AbstractMove
```java

public class ExampleMove extends AbstractMove{

	public ExampleMove() {	
	}

	@Override
	public int compareTo(MoveWrapper move) {
		return 0;
	}

	@Override
	public boolean isValid() {
		return false;
	}
}

```


#### AI Agent

Your agent must extend from the [Agent Move](https://github.com/EudyContreras/Othello-FX-Framework/blob/master/Othello%20FX%20Edu/src/com/eudycontreras/othello/controllers/AgentMove.java) which is a simple POJO containing important information used for determining how good your move algorithm performs, along with other information regarding the move search. The constructor of an *AgentMove* allows the turn/type to be specified as well as a name if you wish to give your agent a name.


> Example Agent class which extends from AgentMove
```java

public class ExampleAgent extends AgentMove{

	@Override
	public AbstractMove getMove(GameBoardState gameState) {
		return yourMove();
	}
}

```



#### Agent Manager

The [Agent Manager](https://github.com/EudyContreras/Othello-FX-Framework/blob/master/Othello%20FX%20Edu/src/main/AgentManager.java) is the class you will use to run your agents. In order to run your agent simply create an instance of your agent and pass it through the second parametter of the instance of Othello just how it is shown below. The game manager will allow you to pass one or two agents. The first agent must always be PlayerOne while the second must always be PlayerTwo. The player type is determine by the turn. Player one always starts. 

> Agent Manager class main launcher application
```java

public class AgentManager extends Application{

	@Override
	public void start(Stage primaryStage) {
		new Othello(primaryStage, new ExampleAgent());
	}
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		launch(args);
	}
}

```


#### Notes


Take a look at the [Agent Manager](https://github.com/EudyContreras/Othello-FX-Framework/blob/master/Othello%20FX%20Edu/src/main/AgentManager.java) to see a variety of helper methods as well as various implementations of different angents. There are other utility classes which might be of help 


#### Customization


The [User Settings](https://github.com/EudyContreras/Othello-FX-Framework/blob/master/Othello%20FX%20Edu/src/main/UserSettings.java) allows you to modify a variety of settings. Here you have a description of each setting.
