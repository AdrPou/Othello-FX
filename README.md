Othello game framework which can be use for adding Othello AI Agents. 


In order to use this framework you need Java 8 as well as JavaFX.
Instructions on how to install the JDK and JavaFX can be found online. 
Most systems will install it automatically so it shouldnt be a problem


Refer to the main folder in order to find the documented files you need
There you will see the UserSettings.java file, AgentManager.java in which you will run
your agent, as well as various example agents and implementations. Take a look
at the agent manager for useful methods, etc

Any questions reach me at.
